These results suggest that language skills are not significantly impaired.\n\n3. **Visuospatial Functions:**\n   - RCFT Copy Score is in the 84th percentile with a Z-score of 1.01, indicating good visuospatial functioning.\n   - Copy Time is average (51st percentile), further supporting normal visuospatial abilities.\n\n4. **Memory Functioning:**\n   - SVLT-E shows strong performance across immediate recalls and delayed recall (88th percentile for delayed recall with a Z-score of 1.22).\n   - Recognition scores are also within the normal range, indicating intact memory function.\n\n5. **Frontal/Executive Functions:**\n   - Contrasting Program and Go-No go tests show results at or below the 15th percentile, suggesting some impairment in executive functions.\n   - Digit Symbol Coding is strong (88th percentile), but errors are zero, which might indicate cautious performance rather than true impairment.\n\n6. **Emotional and Daily Functioning:**\n   - Geriatric Depression Scale scores suggest no significant depressive symptoms.\n   - Barthel ADL indicates independence in daily activities with a score of 20/20.\n\n7. **Overall Cognitive Assessment:**\n   - The SNSB-C Total Score is in the 82nd percentile, indicating overall normal cognitive functioning.\n\nThe subject's performance across most domains is within or above average ranges, except for some mild issues in executive functions (Contrasting Program and Go-No go). However, these do not significantly impact daily living activities. There are no significant impairments in memory, language, attention, visuospatial skills, or emotional well-being.\n\n### Diagnosis\n\n(A) Normal cognition or Subjective Cognitive Decline\n\nThe subject's cognitive performance is largely within normal ranges across most domains, with only mild and isolated issues in executive functions that do not interfere with daily functioning. This pattern aligns more closely with normal cognition or subjective cognitive decline rather than mild cognitive impairment or early-stage dementia/Alzheimer’s disease."}

The results indicate several areas of concern across multiple cognitive domains:\n\n1. **Attention and Working Memory:**\n   - Digit Span Test (Forward) shows a percentile score of 16.86% and Z-score of -0.96, indicating below-average performance.\n   - Backward Digit Span is even lower with a percentile of 6.97% and Z-score of -1.48.\n\n2. **Language Skills:**\n   - The Short Form of the Korean Boston Naming Test (S-K-BNT) has a percentile score of 9.97% and Z-score of -1.28, suggesting significant impairment in naming ability.\n   - Repetition scores are at the lower threshold with a percentile of ≥15.\n\n3. **Visuospatial Functions:**\n   - Rey Complex Figure Test (RCFT) Copy Score is notably low with a percentile score of 3.16% and Z-score of -1.86, indicating significant impairment in visuospatial abilities.\n   - However, the copy time is within normal limits.\n\n4. **Memory Functioning:**\n   - Seoul Verbal Learning Test shows mixed results:\n     - Immediate recall scores are low with a total percentile score of 15.14% and Z-score of -1.03.\n     - Delayed recall is slightly better at 29.02%, but still below average.\n     - Recognition tasks show more normal performance, suggesting some preserved memory function.\n\n5. **Frontal/Executive Functions:**\n   - Digit Symbol Coding (DSC) shows a percentile score of 4.41% and Z-score of -1.70, indicating significant impairment in processing speed and executive functioning.\n   - The Korean Elderly's Version Trail Making Test Part B is severely impaired with a percentile score of 0.01% and Z-score of -3.65.\n\n6. **Emotional and Daily Functioning:**\n   - Geriatric Depression Scale scores are low, indicating no significant depressive symptoms.\n   - Barthel ADL and K-IADL suggest independence in daily activities.\n\n7. **Overall Cognitive Assessment:**\n   - The SNSB-C Total Score is critically low with a percentile score of 1.94% and Z-score of -2.07, suggesting widespread cognitive impairment across domains.\n\nThe pattern of impairments observed in attention, language, visuospatial functions, memory, and executive functioning, combined with the overall low total score, suggests more than isolated deficits or subjective complaints.
