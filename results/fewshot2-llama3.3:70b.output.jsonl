His visuospatial perception and analysis/construction abilities, as measured by the Rey Complex Figure Test (RCFT), are significantly impaired, with a copy score of 30 and a Z score of -1.59, indicating a substantial deviation from the mean. This suggests a significant decline in visuospatial functions.\n\nMemory performance, assessed through the Seoul Verbal Learning Test - Elderly's Version (SVLT-E), shows low immediate recall scores (Total Score = 16) and delayed recall (Score = 5), which are below expected levels, indicating difficulties with verbal learning and memory.

Memory assessment via the Seoul Verbal Learning Test - Elderly's Version showed poor immediate recall (Total Score: 15, %ile Score: 26.42) and significantly impaired delayed recall (Score: 0, %ile Score: 1.09), suggesting difficulties in learning new information and transferring it to long-term memory.\n\nFrontal/executive functions were also compromised, with impairments in mental set shifting, inhibitory control, and the ability to form new concepts. The Controlled Oral Word Association Test results were notably low (Animal: 5, %ile Score: 0.77; ㄱ: 2, %ile Score: 4.44), indicating significant difficulty with verbal fluency.

The results indicate that her general cognitive function is relatively preserved, as suggested by her performance on various tests. In terms of attention, she showed good forward digit span but relatively lower backward digit span, indicating some difficulty with working memory. Her language abilities were within normal limits, including comprehension and repetition. Visuospatial functions, as assessed by the Rey Complex Figure Test (RCFT), showed a copy score that was somewhat below average, suggesting some impairment in visuospatial perception and constructional abilities.\n\nMemory assessment using the Seoul Verbal Learning Test - Elderly's Version (SVLT-E) revealed impaired immediate recall and significantly impaired delayed recall, with a recognition score that was also below average. This pattern suggests difficulties in learning new information and transferring it to long-term memory. Executive functions were variable; she performed well on some tasks like the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT) but showed impairments in others, such as the Contrasting Program and Go-No go tests, indicating issues with executive control and possibly cognitive flexibility.\n\nThe subject's daily living activities, as measured by the Barthel Activities of Daily Living (Barthel-ADL) and Korean Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (K-IADL), showed that she is capable of managing basic self-care but may need assistance with more complex tasks. The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDepS) indicated mild levels of depression.\n\nConsidering these findings, the subject exhibits a mix of preserved and impaired cognitive functions. Her memory, particularly delayed recall, and some aspects of executive function are notably impaired. However, her ability to perform daily living activities, albeit with some assistance needed for complex tasks, and the absence of significant depressive symptoms suggest that she does not meet the criteria for more severe forms of cognitive decline like dementia.\n\n### Diagnosis\n(A) Normal cognition or Subjective cognitive decline. \n\nThe rationale behind this diagnosis is based on the subject's overall performance on the neuropsychological tests, which indicates some cognitive impairments, particularly in memory and certain executive functions, but does not meet the threshold for a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or dementia, given her relatively preserved daily functioning and the absence of significant depressive symptoms.
