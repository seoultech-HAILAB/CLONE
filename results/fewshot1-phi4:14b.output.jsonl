The patient's attention is notably impaired, as evidenced by an abnormal performance on the Vigilance Test and low scores on both forward and backward digit span tests. Language abilities are also reduced, with a short form K-BNT score below average.\n\nPraxis assessment indicates potential ideomotor apraxia, which can be associated with cognitive decline. Visuospatial functions appear relatively preserved based on the RCFT copy score, but memory performance is significantly impaired, particularly in verbal learning and recall tasks as shown by low scores on the SVLT-E immediate recalls and delayed recall.\n\nFrontal/executive function tests reveal deficits in several areas: contrasting program, digit symbol coding with errors, and poor performance on the COWAT. The K-TMT-E Part B results indicate significant difficulties with task-switching and executive control, as evidenced by failure to complete the test within a reasonable time frame and multiple errors.\n\nThe Geriatric Depression Scale suggests clinically significant levels of depression, which can exacerbate cognitive symptoms but does not fully account for the observed deficits. Despite these challenges, the patient maintains some independence in daily living activities, though there is evidence of mild functional decline as indicated by the CDR-SB score.\n\nOverall, the combination of impaired attention, memory, language, and executive functions, along with ideomotor apraxia and significant depressive symptoms, suggests a level of cognitive impairment beyond subjective cognitive decline or normal aging.

Language abilities show significant impairment with very low scores on repetition and confrontational naming tasks (S-K-BNT), indicating potential aphasia or language production issues.\n\nVisuospatial functions are also impaired, as shown by the low Rey Complex Figure Test (RCFT) copy score. Memory performance is notably poor across immediate recall trials in the Seoul Verbal Learning Test - Elderly's Version (SVLT-E), with a total score well below average percentile ranks. Delayed recall and recognition scores further support deficits in memory retention and retrieval.\n\nExecutive functions are significantly compromised, as indicated by low scores on tasks such as Go-No go, Digit Symbol Coding (DSC), and the Korean Color Word Stroop Test (K-CWST-60).

The Trail Making Tests indicate relatively preserved executive function as both parts were completed successfully.\n\nThe Geriatric Depression Scale indicates no clinically significant levels of depression, which suggests that mood disorders are not contributing to cognitive symptoms.\n\nOverall, the patient's performance across most domains is within normal limits or only mildly impaired, and there are no indications of severe functional decline in daily living activities. The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score of 0.5 aligns with subjective cognitive complaints without objective impairment.\n\n### Diagnosis\n\n(A) Normal cognition or Subjective Cognitive Decline.\n\nThe patient's results suggest that while there may be some mild difficulties, particularly in naming and verbal fluency, overall cognitive function is largely preserved. The presence of subjective concerns about memory, combined with the absence of significant functional impairments or severe deficits on objective testing, supports a diagnosis of Subjective Cognitive Decline rather than Mild Cognitive Impairment or early-stage dementia."}

The patient demonstrates a significant decline in verbal memory abilities, as evidenced by low scores on the Seoul Verbal Learning Test - Elderly's Version (SVLT-E), particularly in immediate recall and delayed recall tasks. This suggests an impairment in retention and learning ability within the verbal domain.\n\nAttention functions appear to be relatively preserved, with normal performance on the Vigilance Test and a Digit Span Test score that is slightly below average but not indicative of severe attentional deficits. Language comprehension remains intact, while repetition abilities are notably impaired, as indicated by scores at or above the 15th percentile threshold in the Short Form of the K-BNT (S-K-BNT).\n\nPraxis functions, specifically ideomotor praxis, show impairment with scores below the 15th percentile. Visuospatial perception and construction abilities appear to be within normal limits based on the Rey Complex Figure Test results.\n\nFrontal/executive function tasks reveal mixed performance; while some tests like Digit Symbol Coding (DSC) are performed well above average, others such as Contrasting Program and Go/No-go show impairment with scores at or below the 15th percentile. This suggests variability in executive functioning but not a pervasive deficit across all domains.\n\nThe Geriatric Depression Scale indicates mild depressive symptoms, which could potentially influence cognitive performance but does not fully account for the observed deficits.\n\nOverall, the pattern of cognitive decline is primarily within the verbal memory domain, with some additional impairments in repetition and certain aspects of frontal/executive functions.
