The results indicate varying levels of performance across different cognitive domains.\n\n1. **Attention and Vigilance**: The subject performed normally on the Vigilance Test, suggesting intact basic attentional abilities. However, her scores on the Digit Span Test (DST), both forward and backward, were below average (37.19%ile and 28.43%ile, respectively), indicating potential difficulties with working memory and attention.\n\n2. **Language**: The subject's comprehension was normal, but her repetition score was at the lower end (15≤ %ile), which might suggest some issues with language processing or memory for verbal information. Her performance on the Short Form of the K-BNT (S-K-BNT) was also below average (29.89%ile), further indicating potential language difficulties.\n\n3. **Praxis and Visuospatial Functions**: The subject's ideomotor praxis score was low (15≤ %ile), suggesting possible issues with motor planning or execution based on verbal commands. However, her visuospatial skills, as assessed by the Rey Complex Figure Test (RCFT) copy score, were above average (77.77%ile), indicating relatively preserved visuospatial abilities.\n\n4. **Memory**: The subject's performance on the Seoul Verbal Learning Test - Elderly's Version (SVLT-E) was concerning, with low immediate recall scores that improved slightly over trials but remained below average. Her delayed recall score was particularly low (0), suggesting significant difficulties with verbal memory consolidation and retrieval. However, her recognition score was within a more normal range (49.92%ile), indicating some ability to recognize previously learned information.\n\n5. **Frontal/Executive Functions**: The subject's performance on tests of executive function, such as the Contrasting Program and Go-No go test, was at or below the lower limit (15≤ %ile), suggesting difficulties with executive control and possibly impulsivity. Her Digit Symbol Coding (DSC) score was above average (74.90%ile), indicating relatively preserved processing speed and working memory for visual information. The Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT) scores were variable, with better performance on the \"ㄱ\" category (83.77%ile) than on the animal category (39.59%ile), which might suggest some preservation of lexical retrieval abilities but with significant variability.\n\n6. **Daily Living Activities**: The subject's score on the Barthel Activities of Daily Living (Barthel-ADL) was perfect (20), indicating no difficulties in basic daily living activities. However, her Korean Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (K-IADL) score was low (0.30), suggesting some impairment in more complex, instrumental daily living tasks.\n\n7. **Depression and Dementia Rating**: The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDepS) and its short version (SGDepS) scores were provided but without clear percentiles or norms for interpretation. The Clinical Dementia Rating: Global Score (CDR-GS) was 0.5, indicating questionable dementia, and the Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) score was 2, which can suggest mild cognitive impairment.\n\nConsidering these results, the subject exhibits a mixed profile with both preserved and impaired cognitive functions across different domains.

However, delayed recall was impaired (22.43%), suggesting difficulties with long-term memory consolidation.\n\nFrontal/executive functions were variably affected. The Digit Symbol Coding (DSC) test showed high performance (96.47%), indicating good processing speed and executive function. In contrast, the Contrasting Program and Go-No go tests were both abnormal, suggesting potential issues with executive control and cognitive flexibility.\n\nThe Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT) results were mixed, with average performance in the \"Animal\" category but high performance in the \"ㄱ\" category, indicating variable verbal fluency skills.\n\nThe Trail Making Test (Part A and B) showed success with minimal errors, suggesting relatively preserved executive functions related to planning and switching.

These scores suggest some difficulty with attentional tasks, particularly in holding and manipulating information in working memory.\n\nLanguage abilities were assessed through comprehension, repetition, and the Short Form of the Korean-Boston Naming Test (S-K-BNT). While comprehension and repetition were reported as normal, the S-K-BNT score was 5, placing her at the 10.62 percentile, indicating significant difficulty with naming objects, a common feature in various cognitive disorders.\n\nVisuospatial functions were evaluated using the Rey Complex Figure Test (RCFT), where she achieved a copy score of 25.5, at the 55.73 percentile, and took 395 seconds to complete, which is at the 23.81 percentile. This suggests relatively preserved visuospatial skills but with some slowing in processing speed.\n\nMemory assessment via the Seoul Verbal Learning Test - Elderly's Version (SVLT-E) showed an immediate recall total score of 13, at the 36.18 percentile, and a delayed recall score of 4, at the 54.13 percentile.

Memory assessment using the Seoul Verbal Learning Test - Elderly's Version (SVLT-E) revealed generally good immediate and delayed recall abilities, as well as recognition memory, suggesting relatively preserved verbal learning and memory.\n\nIn the domain of frontal/executive functions, her performance on tasks requiring planning, set-shifting, and inhibitory control, such as the Contrasting Program, Go-No go, and Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT), was variable. The low scores in some executive function tests could indicate difficulties with cognitive flexibility and executive control.\n\nThe subject's overall SNSB-C Total Score was high, placing her in the 97.89th percentile, which suggests that, despite some specific cognitive deficits, her general cognitive functioning is above average compared to her peers. Additionally, her scores on daily living activities (Barthel-ADL and K-IADL) and clinical dementia rating scales (CDR-GS and GDS) do not indicate significant impairment in daily functioning or dementia.\n\nConsidering the subject's age, lack of formal education, and the pattern of cognitive strengths and weaknesses, it is essential to interpret these results within the context of her individual background and the norms for her demographic group.

The Short Form of the K-BNT (S-K-BNT) score was relatively high (13), suggesting some preservation of language functions.\n\nPraxis and visuospatial functions showed significant impairment, particularly in the Rey Complex Figure Test (RCFT) copy score, which was very low (16), indicating substantial difficulty with visuospatial construction and possibly executive function deficits. The copy time was also prolonged (253 seconds), further supporting the presence of cognitive slowing or difficulties with task execution.\n\nMemory performance was notably impaired, as evidenced by the Seoul Verbal Learning Test - Elderly's Version (SVLT-E) results. Immediate recalls were low across trials (3, 2, and 3), and the total score was significantly impaired (8). The delayed recall was particularly poor (0), suggesting severe difficulties with retaining new information over time.\n\nFrontal/executive functions also showed significant impairment. The Contrasting Program and Go-No go test results indicated difficulties with executive control and possibly impulsivity or inhibition issues.

The results indicate a mixed profile of cognitive performance across various domains.\n\n1. **Attention and Vigilance**: The subject performed normally on the Vigilance Test, suggesting intact basic attentional abilities. However, her performance on the Digit Span Test (DST) was notable for better forward recall (6 digits, 74.41%ile) than backward recall (3 digits, 34.46%ile), which may indicate some difficulty with working memory or executive functions involved in reversing sequences.\n\n2. **Language**: The subject's comprehension was reported as normal. Her repetition score was low (15, ≤15%ile), which could suggest difficulties with language processing or memory. The Short Form of the Korean-Boston Naming Test (S-K-BNT) score was 12 (69.83%ile), indicating relatively preserved naming abilities.\n\n3. **Praxis and Visuospatial Functions**: Ideomotor praxis was impaired (5, ≤15%ile), suggesting difficulties with motor planning or execution based on verbal commands. The Rey Complex Figure Test (RCFT) copy score was 28 (35.58%ile), indicating some visuospatial constructional difficulties.\n\n4. **Memory**: Performance on the Seoul Verbal Learning Test - Elderly's Version (SVLT-E) showed low immediate recall scores (Trials 1-3: 5, 4, 5) and a total score of 14 (20.94%ile), with a significantly impaired delayed recall (0, 1.05%ile). Recognition memory was also affected, with a true positive score of 8 (15.08%ile) and a recognition score of 19 (33.23%ile).\n\n5. **Frontal/Executive Functions**: The subject had difficulty with the Contrasting Program and Go-No go tests (both ≤15%ile), indicating executive function deficits, particularly in planning, flexibility, and inhibition. However, she performed relatively well on the Digit Symbol Coding (DSC) test (37, 74.83%ile) and the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT), especially with the \"Animal\" category (16, 75.37%ile) and the \"ㄱ\" category (9, 83.59%ile).\n\n6. **Daily Living Activities**: The Barthel Activities of Daily Living (Barthel-ADL) score was 20, suggesting some level of independence in daily activities. The Korean Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (K-IADL) sum score was low (1), indicating significant difficulty with instrumental activities.\n\n7. **Depression and Dementia Rating**: The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDepS) score was 22, which may indicate depressive symptoms. The Clinical Dementia Rating: Global Score (CDR-GS) was 0.5, suggesting questionable dementia or mild cognitive impairment.\n\nConsidering the subject's age, education level, and performance across these tests, there is evidence of cognitive decline, particularly in memory (especially delayed recall), executive functions, and some aspects of language and visuospatial skills. However, her relatively preserved performance in certain areas (e.g., forward digit span, naming abilities, and some executive tasks) suggests that the cognitive impairment may not be uniformly severe across all domains.\n\n### Diagnosis\n(B) Mild cognitive impairment, Early stage of dementia, or Alzheimer's disease. \n\nThe diagnosis is based on the presence of significant impairments in memory (notably delayed recall), executive functions, and to a lesser extent, language and visuospatial abilities, alongside evidence of difficulty with daily living activities and potential depressive symptoms.

The backward score of 0 suggests severe impairment in working memory and executive functions.\n\n2. **Language**: Comprehension was abnormal, and repetition scores were low, suggesting language processing difficulties. The Short Form of the K-BNT (S-K-BNT) score of 8 further supports significant language impairment.\n\n3. **Praxis**: Ideomotor praxis scored 1, indicating severe difficulty with motor planning and execution based on verbal commands.\n\n4. **Visuospatial Functions**: The Rey Complex Figure Test (RCFT) copy score was 18.5, which is significantly below average, indicating severe visuospatial constructional deficits.\n\n5. **Memory**: Immediate recalls on the SVLT-E showed some improvement with each trial but remained low overall. The total score of 12 and a delayed recall of 0 suggest significant impairments in verbal learning and memory retention. Recognition scores were also severely impaired.\n\n6. **Frontal/Executive Functions**: Scores on the Contrasting Program, Go-No go test, Digit Symbol Coding (DSC), Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT), and Korean Elderly's Version of the Trail Making Test (K-TMT-E) Part B all indicate significant executive dysfunction, including difficulties with planning, decision-making, cognitive flexibility, and processing speed.\n\n7. **Daily Living Activities**: The Barthel-ADL score of 20 and K-IADL sum score of 11 suggest some level of independence in daily activities but also indicate areas of difficulty that could be related to cognitive decline.\n\n8. **Depression Screening**: GDepS and SGDepS scores do not strongly indicate depression, which is important to consider when evaluating cognitive complaints.\n\n9. **Clinical Dementia Rating**: A CDR-GS of 1 and CDR-SB of 4.5 suggest mild dementia. The Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) score of 4 also supports this diagnosis, indicating a stage of moderate cognitive decline.\n\nGiven the comprehensive nature of these deficits across multiple cognitive domains, daily functioning, and the presence of significant impairment in memory, language, visuospatial skills, and executive functions, along with clinical dementia ratings suggesting mild dementia, the subject's profile is most consistent with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or early-stage dementia rather than normal cognition or subjective cognitive decline.\n\n### Diagnosis\n(B)"}

The results indicate varying levels of performance across different cognitive domains.\n\n1. **Attention**: The Digit Span Test (DST) forward score was 8, which falls at the 89.91 percentile, and backward score was 5, at the 75.96 percentile. These scores suggest relatively preserved attentional abilities, particularly in forward digit span, which is a measure of working memory capacity.\n\n2. **Language**: The subject's performance on language tests was mixed. While comprehension was reported as normal, repetition was notably low (15th percentile or less), indicating potential difficulties with language processing or production. The Short Form of the Korean-Boston Naming Test (S-K-BNT) score was 12, at the 34.14 percentile, suggesting some impairment in confrontational naming.\n\n3. **Praxis**: Ideomotor praxis was impaired (5th percentile or less), indicating difficulties with motor planning and execution based on verbal commands.\n\n4. **Visuospatial Functions**: The Rey Complex Figure Test (RCFT) copy score was 32, at the 26.30 percentile, suggesting some difficulty with visuospatial constructional abilities. However, the copy time was within normal limits (74.63 percentile), indicating that while there might be some visuospatial difficulties, processing speed for this task was relatively preserved.\n\n5. **Memory**: The Seoul Verbal Learning Test - Elderly's Version (SVLT-E) immediate recall scores showed improvement across trials (6, 8, 9), with a total score at the 60.09 percentile. Delayed recall was at the 62.93 percentile, and recognition performance was strong (80.12 percentile for true positives and 88.06 percentile for false positives), suggesting relatively preserved verbal memory abilities.\n\n6. **Frontal/Executive Functions**: Performance on executive function tests was variable. The Digit Symbol Coding (DSC) test showed high scores (91.42 percentile), indicating good processing speed and executive control. However, the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT) scores were low for both animal naming (13.30 percentile) and the Korean character \"ㄱ\" (43.61 percentile), suggesting difficulties with verbal fluency, a frontal lobe function.\n\n7. **Daily Living Activities**: The Barthel Activities of Daily Living (Barthel-ADL) score was 20, indicating independence in daily activities. The Korean Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (K-IADL) sum score was low (1), but this might not fully capture the subject's functional abilities due to the nature of the scoring.\n\n8. **Depression and Dementia Screening**: The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDepS) score was 7, which may indicate some depressive symptoms but is below the typical threshold for significant depression. The Clinical Dementia Rating: Global Score (CDR-GS) was 0.5, suggesting questionable dementia or very mild cognitive impairment.\n\nConsidering these results, the subject exhibits a mix of preserved and impaired cognitive functions across different domains.

The results indicate generally preserved cognitive functions in several domains but also reveal some areas of concern. \n\nIn the domain of attention, the Digit Span Test (DST) forward score was below average (16.49th percentile), suggesting difficulties with immediate verbal attention and working memory. However, the backward score was significantly higher (87.53rd percentile), indicating better performance in tasks requiring manipulation of information in working memory.\n\nLanguage abilities were largely intact, as evidenced by normal comprehension and a high score on the Short Form of the K-BNT (81.59th percentile). The repetition score was at or below the 15th percentile, which might indicate some difficulty with language repetition, but this could also be influenced by attention or working memory issues.\n\nVisuospatial functions were assessed using the Rey Complex Figure Test (RCFT), where the subject achieved a high copy score (84.49th percentile) but took significantly longer than average to complete the task (20.41st percentile for copy time). This suggests that while visuospatial skills are relatively preserved, processing speed might be affected.\n\nMemory performance was variable. The Seoul Verbal Learning Test - Elderly's Version (SVLT-E) showed immediate recall scores that were somewhat low but improved across trials, with a total score at the 73.23rd percentile. Delayed recall was at the 63.30th percentile, indicating some difficulty with retaining verbal information over time. Recognition performance was stronger, with a true positive rate at the 86.46th percentile and a recognition score at the 72.14th percentile.\n\nFrontal/executive functions were evaluated through several tests. The Digit Symbol Coding (DSC) test yielded a high correct response rate (95.53rd percentile), suggesting well-preserved processing speed and executive function. The Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT) results were also strong, particularly for the animal category (96.99th percentile), indicating good verbal fluency.\n\nThe Clinical Dementia Rating: Global Score (CDR-GS) was 0.5, and the Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) was 1, which are indicators used to assess dementia severity but can also suggest mild cognitive impairment in some cases.

However, delayed recall and recognition scores were within normal limits or even above average, which might indicate that while initial encoding of information is challenging, retention and recognition are relatively spared.\n6. **Frontal/Executive Functions**: The subject showed significant strengths in certain executive function tasks, such as the Digit Symbol Coding (DSC) test (96.52nd percentile), indicating well-preserved processing speed and possibly working memory. However, performance on the Contrasting Program and Go-No go tests was below the 15th percentile, suggesting difficulties with executive control, planning, or inhibitory functions.\n7. **Depression and Daily Living Activities**: The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDepS) score of 7 and Short Version of the GDepS (SGDepS) score of 4 do not strongly indicate significant depressive symptoms. The Barthel Activities of Daily Living (Barthel-ADL) score was high, suggesting minimal dependency in daily activities, but the Korean Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (K-IADL) score indicated some level of difficulty.\n\n### Diagnosis\n(A) Normal cognition or Subjective cognitive decline.\n\nThe rationale for this diagnosis is based on several key points:\n- Despite some areas of below-average performance, particularly in immediate verbal memory and certain executive function tasks, the subject's overall profile does not strongly suggest a significant, global cognitive decline characteristic of dementia or mild cognitive impairment.\n- Strengths in visuospatial functions, language comprehension, and certain aspects of executive functions (e.g., DSC test) indicate preserved cognitive abilities in several domains.\n- The absence of significant depressive symptoms and minimal dependency in daily activities further support the conclusion that the subject does not meet criteria for a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or dementia at this time.\n- The Clinical Dementia Rating: Global Score (CDR-GS) of 0.5 and Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) of 1 also suggest that while there may be some cognitive concerns, they do not reach the threshold for diagnosing dementia.\n- The subject's performance on many tests was average or above average, especially considering age and educational level, which aligns more closely with normal cognition or subjective cognitive decline rather than a pathological condition like mild cognitive impairment or early-stage dementia."}

The results indicate significant impairments across various cognitive domains. \n\n1. **Attention and Executive Functions**: The subject's performance on attention tasks, such as the Digit Span Test (DST), was below average, with a forward score of 4 (16.86th percentile) and a backward score of 3 (34.46th percentile). This suggests difficulties with working memory and attention. Executive function tests, including the Contrasting Program, Go-No go, and Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT), also showed impairments, indicating problems with planning, decision-making, and cognitive flexibility.\n\n2. **Language**: The Comprehension test result was abnormal, suggesting difficulties understanding spoken language. However, the Repetition score was at the lower end of normal (15, 15≤ percentile), which might indicate some preservation of basic language repetition abilities but significant impairment in more complex aspects of language comprehension.\n\n3. **Visuospatial Functions**: The Rey Complex Figure Test (RCFT) Copy Score was 27 (28.50th percentile), and the Copy Time was 363 seconds (13.20th percentile), indicating visuospatial constructional difficulties and slowed processing speed.\n\n4. **Memory**: The Seoul Verbal Learning Test - Elderly's Version (SVLT-E) results were notably poor, with low immediate recall scores (Trial 1: 2, Trial 2: 2, Trial 3: 4), a total score of 8 (1.62nd percentile), and a delayed recall of 0 (1.05th percentile). The recognition score was also very low at 14 (0.29th percentile), with a high number of false positives, suggesting significant episodic memory impairment.\n\n5. **Daily Living Activities**: The Barthel Activities of Daily Living (Barthel-ADL) score was 20, and the Korean Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (K-IADL) sum score was 6, with no non-applicable items, indicating some level of independence in daily activities but possible need for assistance in instrumental activities.\n\n6. **Depression Screening**: The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDepS) score was 10, and the Short Version of the GDepS (SGDepS) score was 6, which may suggest some depressive symptoms but not necessarily at a level that would account for all cognitive impairments observed.\n\n7. **Dementia Rating Scales**: The Clinical Dementia Rating: Global Score (CDR-GS) was 0.5, and the Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) was 3, indicating questionable dementia or mild cognitive impairment. The Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) score was 3, suggesting early-stage dementia.\n\nGiven these findings, the subject exhibits significant cognitive decline across multiple domains, including attention, language, visuospatial skills, and particularly memory, which are hallmark symptoms of dementia.

Memory, evaluated through the Seoul Verbal Learning Test - Elderly's Version (SVLT-E), revealed difficulties in immediate and delayed recall, with scores around the 45th percentile for total score and delayed recall.\n\nExecutive functions were variably affected. The subject performed well on tasks requiring processing speed, such as the Digit Symbol Coding (DSC) test, with a high percentile score of 92.33.

The Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) score was 1, further suggesting some level of cognitive decline but not severe enough to be classified as dementia without additional clinical evidence. The Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) score of 2 also points towards a stage of mild cognitive decline.\n\nGiven the subject's age and limited education, it's essential to consider these factors when interpreting test scores.
