The neuropsychological assessment results show that the patient's general cognitive function was found to be good on the K-MMSE-2. However, there are some areas where the patient performed below average.\n\nIn the attention domain, the patient scored below average in the Digit Span Test (DST) - Backward, with a raw score of 3 and a %ile score of 49.84. This suggests that the patient may have difficulty with working memory or processing speed.\n\nIn the language domain, the patient's confrontation naming ability was at a marginal level but within the normal range. However, the patient scored below average in the Short Form of the K-BNT (S-K-BNT), with a raw score of 15 and a %ile score of 98.81. This suggests that the patient may have difficulty with semantic memory or word retrieval.\n\nIn the visuospatial domain, the patient's performance on the Rey Complex Figure Test (RCFT) - Copy Score was below average, with a raw score of 27 and a %ile score of 54.99. This suggests that the patient may have difficulty with visual perception or spatial reasoning.\n\nIn the memory domain, the patient scored below average in the Seoul Verbal Learning Test - Elderly's Version (SVLT-E) - Immediate Recalls: Trial 1, with a raw score of 5 and a %ile score not available. This suggests that the patient may have difficulty with verbal learning or memory consolidation.\n\nIn the frontal lobe/executive functions domain, the patient scored below average in the Digit Symbol Coding (DSC), with a raw score of 22 and a %ile score of 61.03.
