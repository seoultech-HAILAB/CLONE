**Step-by-Step Guidelines for Interpreting SNSB-C Test Results**

### Step 1: Evaluate General Cognitive Function

* Review the K-MMSE-2 score to determine overall cognitive function.
* Excellent performance (e.g., high %ile score and z-score) indicates strong general cognitive abilities, suggesting **Option A: Normal cognition or Subjective cognitive decline**.

### Step 2: Assess Attention and Concentration Abilities

* Examine the Digit Span Test (DST) Forward and Backward scores, including %ile scores and z-scores.
* Impaired performance (e.g., low %ile score ≤ 10 and z-score ≤ -1.0) may indicate difficulties with working memory and attention, suggesting **Option B: Mild cognitive impairment, Early stage of dementia, or Alzheimer's disease**.

### Step 3: Evaluate Language Domain

* Assess the Short Form of the K-BNT (S-K-BNT) score, including %ile score and z-score.
* A %ile score ≤ 5 and a z-score ≤ -2.0 may indicate significant impairment in confrontation naming ability, suggesting **Option B: Mild cognitive impairment, Early stage of dementia, or Alzheimer's disease**.
* Repetition test results with raw scores and %ile scores < 5 may also indicate difficulties with repetition.

### Step 4: Assess Visuospatial Functions

* Review the Rey Complex Figure Test (RCFT) Copy Score, including %ile score and z-score.
* A %ile score ≤ 5 and a z-score ≤ -1.5 may indicate decline in visuospatial perception and analysis/construction abilities, suggesting **Option B: Mild cognitive impairment, Early stage of dementia, or Alzheimer's disease**.

### Step 5: Evaluate Frontal/Executive Functions

* Examine the Digit Symbol Coding (DSC) test results, including raw scores, %ile scores, and z-scores.
* A %ile score ≤ 5 and a z-score ≤ -1.5 may indicate decreased psychomotor speed, suggesting **Option B: Mild cognitive impairment, Early stage of dementia, or Alzheimer's disease**.
* Assess the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT) results, specifically the animal category, looking for raw scores and %ile scores that suggest a decrease in semantic generative naming ability (< 15).
* Evaluate the Trail Making Test Part B time and corresponding %ile score and z-score. A %ile score ≤ 5 and a z-score ≤ -1.5 may indicate difficulties with mental set shifting and divided attention.
* Review the Korean Color Word Stroop Test (K-CWST-60) Color Reading correct responses and corresponding %ile score and z-score. A %ile score ≤ 5 and a z-score ≤ -2.0 may suggest impaired inhibitory control.

### Step 6: Assess Memory

* Examine the Seoul Verbal Learning Test-Elderly's Version (SVLT-E) Immediate Recalls, Total Score, and Delayed Recall score.
* Look for %ile scores and z-scores that indicate some impairment in memory (e.g., %ile score < 20 and z-score ≤ -1.0).
* However, if recognition memory is relatively preserved (e.g., %ile score > 50 and z-score ≥ 0), it may not be a significant indicator of cognitive decline.

### Step 7: Consider Other Domains

* Evaluate attention as measured by the Digit Span Test (DST) Forward and backward tests.
* A raw score ≤ 5 and a %ile score ≤ 10 on the backward test may indicate impaired attention, suggesting **Option B: Mild cognitive impairment, Early stage of dementia, or Alzheimer's disease**.
* Review the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDepS) and Short Version of the GDepS (SGDepS) scores to rule out clinically significant levels of depression.

### Step 8: Determine Diagnosis

* If cognitive decline is present in one or more domains (e.g., language, visuospatial, frontal/executive) without significant impairment in memory, consider a diagnosis of **Option B: Mild cognitive impairment, Early stage of dementia, or Alzheimer's disease**.
* If the patient's ability to perform daily living activities independently is preserved, it supports a diagnosis of **Option A: Normal cognition or Subjective cognitive decline** rather than **Option B: Mild cognitive impairment, Early stage of dementia, or Alzheimer's disease**.
* Neuropsychological test results indicating cognitive decline that is more pronounced than subjectively reported may also support the need for close monitoring and possible intervention to prevent further decline.

### Step 9: Consider Cases with Mixed Results

* If cognitive impairment is observed in one domain (e.g., language, visuospatial), but does not cause issues in daily life, consider **Option A: Normal cognition or Subjective cognitive decline**.
* If cognitive impairment is observed in multiple domains (e.g., language, visuospatial, frontal/executive), and causes significant issues in daily life, consider **Option B: Mild cognitive impairment, Early stage of dementia, or Alzheimer's disease**.
* If cognitive impairment is observed in one domain (e.g., memory), but is not severe enough to cause significant issues in daily life, consider **Option A: Normal cognition or Subjective cognitive decline**.

### Step 10: Finalize Diagnosis

* Based on the evaluation of all domains and consideration of mixed results, determine the final diagnosis:
	+ **Option A: Normal cognition or Subjective cognitive decline**: If no significant cognitive impairment is observed, or if cognitive impairment is present but does not cause significant issues in daily life.
	+ **Option B: Mild cognitive impairment, Early stage of dementia, or Alzheimer's disease**: If significant cognitive impairment is observed in one or more domains, and causes significant issues in daily life.

By following these step-by-step guidelines, you can utilize objective statistical data to interpret SNSB-C test results and determine where the subject's cognitive level falls among the provided options.
