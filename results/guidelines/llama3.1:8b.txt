Here are the step-by-step guidelines for interpreting SNSB-C test results:

**Step 1: Review Overall Performance**

* Calculate the SNSB-C Total Score and determine its percentile rank to understand the patient's overall performance.
* Identify if the %ile score is above 75 (e.g., 82.79), suggesting excellent overall attention abilities, or below 25 (e.g., 71.40), indicating a slight decline in specific cognitive functions.

**Step 2: Evaluate Cognitive Domain-Specific Performance**

* Calculate the Z Score and %ile scores for each cognitive domain:
	+ Language: Confrontational naming ability, repetition skills
	+ Visuospatial Functions: Rey Complex Figure Test - Copy Score
	+ Memory: Seoul Verbal Learning Test - Elderly's Version (Immediate Recalls, Delayed Recall, Recognition, and Recognition Discriminability Index)
	+ Frontal/Executive Functions: Contrasting Program (ability to form new concepts)
* If the %ile scores for these domains are above 75 (e.g., 76.18), suggesting good performance, proceed to Step 3.

**Step 3: Identify Specific Cognitive Weaknesses**

* Calculate the Z Score and %ile scores for tasks that indicate specific cognitive weaknesses:
	+ Digit Span Test - Backward
	+ Korean Color Word Stroop Test 60 Seconds (K-CWST-60) - Color Reading
	+ Repetition skills (%ile â‰¤ 15)
* If the %ile scores are below 25 (e.g., %ile = 71.40), indicating a slight decline in specific cognitive functions, proceed to Step 4.

**Step 4: Consider Self-Reported Information**

* Review self-reported information on mood and daily functioning:
	+ GDepS, SGDepS (mild levels of depression)
	+ Daily living skills and instrumental activities
* If the patient reports mild levels of depression, but daily living skills and instrumental activities are generally preserved, proceed to Step 5.

**Step 5: Determine Cognitive Level**

* Based on the combination of excellent overall attention abilities, good to very good performance in various cognitive domains, specific areas of decline, and self-reported mild levels of depression:
	+ If the patient's condition corresponds to Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD), with specific areas of decline, diagnose as SCD.
	+ Otherwise, consider diagnosing as Normal Cognition or Subjective Cognitive Decline, depending on the severity of symptoms.

**Step 6: Evaluate Exclusion Criteria**

* Review results from tasks that may help rule out other explanations for cognitive complaints:
	+ Geriatric Depression Scale (GDepS) and Short Version of the GDepS (SGDepS): assess for depression.
	+ Trail Making Test (TMT): evaluates executive functions.
* If there are no significant impairments in these areas, proceed to Step 7.

**Step 7: Combine Objective Metrics and Subjective Reports**

* Synthesize the information from Steps 1-6 to determine if there is a pattern of subtle cognitive difficulties or impairment across multiple domains.
* Consider whether the combination of normal or slightly impaired performance, along with subjective complaints, supports a diagnosis of Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD).

**Step 8: Evaluate Objective Data**

* Review all relevant test scores to ensure that no other domains show significant declines or abnormalities.
* Consider any scores that may indicate a need for further evaluation or follow-up.

**Step 9: Determine the Diagnostic Category**

* Based on the analysis, determine which diagnostic category the patient falls under:
	+ Normal cognition or Subjective cognitive decline (if no significant impairments are found)
	+ Mild cognitive impairment, Early stage of dementia, or Alzheimer's disease (if significant impairments are found in multiple domains)

**Step 10: Make a Diagnosis**

* Based on the analysis, make a diagnosis for the patient:
	+ In cases where cognitive impairment is observed in one domain but does not cause issues in daily life, consider diagnosing as Normal Cognition.
	+ If there is evidence of significant impairments in multiple domains and the patient's condition corresponds to Mild Cognitive Impairment, Early stage of dementia, or Alzheimer's disease, diagnose accordingly.
