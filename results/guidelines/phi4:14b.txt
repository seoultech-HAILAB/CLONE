## Step-by-Step Guidelines for Interpreting SNSB-C Test Results

### Introduction
The SNSB-C test results provide comprehensive data across various cognitive domains. These guidelines help determine whether a subject's cognitive level aligns with normal cognition/subjective cognitive decline (SCD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), early-stage dementia, or Alzheimer's disease.

### Step 1: Evaluate General Cognitive Function
- **Objective Data**: Review general cognitive scores such as K-MMSE-2 and overall SNSB-II.
- **Interpretation**:
  - **Option A**: Good performance across domains suggests normal cognition or SCD. 
  - **Option B**: Poor performance in these metrics may indicate MCI, early-stage dementia, or Alzheimer's disease.

### Step 2: Assess Attention
- **Objective Data**: Analyze scores from attention-related tasks.
- **Interpretation**:
  - **Option A**: Normal range performance supports intact vigilance and focus, indicating normal cognition or SCD.
  - **Option B**: Impairment in attention could suggest MCI or early dementia.

### Step 3: Evaluate Memory Function
- **Objective Data**: Consider scores from the Seoul Verbal Learning Test - Elderly's Version (SVLT-E).
- **Interpretation**:
  - **Option A**: High percentile scores and strong delayed recall indicate normal cognition or SCD.
  - **Option B**: Poor memory performance, especially in delayed recall, suggests MCI or early dementia.

### Step 4: Analyze Language Skills
- **Objective Data**: Review comprehension, repetition, and naming abilities.
- **Interpretation**:
  - **Option A**: Performance within normal limits supports maintained language function, aligning with SCD if subjective concerns exist.
  - **Option B**: Significant issues in language tasks may indicate MCI or dementia.

### Step 5: Assess Visuospatial Functions
- **Objective Data**: Examine performance on the Rey Complex Figure Test (RCFT).
- **Interpretation**:
  - **Option A**: Good scores suggest healthy visuospatial skills, supporting normal cognition or SCD.
  - **Option B**: Poor performance in visuospatial tasks may indicate MCI or early dementia.

### Step 6: Evaluate Executive Function
- **Objective Data**: Review tasks like Digit Symbol Coding test (DSC) and Trail Making Test (K-TMT-E).
- **Interpretation**:
  - **Option A**: High performance indicates intact executive functions, supporting normal cognition or SCD.
  - **Option B**: Impairments in these areas suggest MCI or early dementia.

### Step 7: Consider Mood Assessment
- **Objective Data**: Analyze depression scales.
- **Interpretation**:
  - **Option A**: Absence of significant depressive symptoms supports a diagnosis of normal cognition or SCD.
  - **Option B**: Significant depression could contribute to cognitive decline, warranting further investigation.

### Step 8: Review Daily Living Activities
- **Objective Data**: Assess patient reports on daily activities.
- **Interpretation**:
  - **Option A**: No reported difficulties suggest functional independence, aligning with SCD if subjective concerns are present.
  - **Option B**: Reported difficulties in daily tasks may indicate MCI or early dementia.

### Step 9: Interpret Percentile Scores and Z-Scores
- **Objective Data**: Compare scores to normative data.
- **Interpretation**:
  - **Option A**: High percentile scores (e.g., 97th percentile) across tasks suggest strengths without significant deficits, supporting normal cognition or SCD.
  - **Option B**: Low percentile and Z-scores indicate impairments consistent with MCI or early dementia.

### Step 10: Synthesize Clinical Context
- **Objective Data**: Consider the combination of test results and subjective reports.
- **Interpretation**:
  - **Option A**: Normal objective measures with subjective cognitive concerns align with SCD, as there are no significant deficits to suggest more severe impairments.
  - **Option B**: Objective evidence of deficits across multiple domains supports a diagnosis of MCI, early-stage dementia, or Alzheimer's disease.

### Conclusion
- **Diagnosis**:
  - **Option A**: Subjective Cognitive Decline is supported when subjective concerns exist without corresponding objective evidence from testing that would indicate more severe cognitive impairments.
  - **Option B**: Mild Cognitive Impairment or early-stage dementia/Alzheimer's disease is indicated by significant deficits in one or more cognitive domains, particularly if these impairments affect daily functioning.

By following these steps and focusing on objective statistical data from neuropsychological tests, you can determine where a subject's cognitive level falls among the given options. Regular monitoring is recommended to detect any future changes in cognitive status.
