**Step-by-Step Interpretation of SNSB-C Test Results**

1. **Assess Attention:**
   - Evaluate Digit Span forward and backward scores.
   - Normal performance suggests intact attentional abilities.

2. **Evaluate Language Function:**
   - Review Repetition and S-K-BNT (naming test) scores.
   - Low Repetition score indicates verbal repetition issues, while normal naming suggests specific language impairment.

3. **Examine Visuospatial Skills:**
   - Analyze Rey Complex Figure Test results for copy and time.
   - Normal scores imply intact visuospatial abilities, ruling out conditions like dementia with Lewy bodies.

4. **Analyze Memory Performance:**
   - Focus on SVLT-E Immediate Recall, Delayed Recall, and Recognition.
   - Low scores in these areas indicate significant verbal memory deficits, especially in retention.

5. **Evaluate Frontal/Executive Functions:**
   - Assess Trail Making Test Part B and Stroop test results.
   - Normal or above-average performance suggests intact executive functions.

6. **Consider Other Factors:**
   - Check for signs of depression using GDepS and SGDepS.
   - Review Barthel-ADL for daily functioning and CDR-GS for dementia staging.

7. **Synthesize Findings:**
   - Identify the primary cognitive deficit, focusing on verbal memory impairment with spared other domains.

8. **Diagnosis:**
   - Conclude single domain amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment based on isolated verbal memory deficits and normal functioning in other areas.

This structured approach ensures a comprehensive understanding of cognitive strengths and weaknesses, guiding an accurate diagnosis.
