However, a definitive conclusion about his general cognitive function requires considering all domain-specific performances.\n\n2. **Attention and Concentration Abilities**: The Digit Span Test (DST) Forward score is 5 with a %ile score of 16.49 and a z-score of -0.97, suggesting some impairment in attention and working memory. However, the DST Backward score is 5 with a %ile score of 87.53 and a z-score of 1.15, indicating better performance in this aspect.\n\n3. **Language Domain**: The Short Form of the K-BNT (S-K-BNT) score is 14 with a %ile score of 81.59 and a z-score of 0.90, showing relatively intact language abilities.

However, the repetition test result was ≤ 15, which may indicate some difficulty with repetition.\n\n3. **Visuospatial Functions**: The Rey Complex Figure Test (RCFT) Copy Score was 28 (0.71%ile, z-score = -2.45), indicating significant impairment in visuospatial perception and analysis/construction abilities.\n\n4. **Memory**: The Seoul Verbal Learning Test-Elderly's Version (SVLT-E) Total Score was 25 (80.73%ile, z-score = 0.87), and the Delayed Recall score was 7 (54.73%ile, z-score = 0.12). These results suggest relatively preserved memory abilities.\n\n5. **Frontal/Executive Functions**: The Digit Symbol Coding (DSC) test result was 79 (97.95%ile, z-score = 2.04), indicating excellent psychomotor speed and executive function. The Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT) animal category score was 21 (84.49%ile, z-score = 1.01), suggesting relatively preserved semantic generative naming ability.\n\n6. **Other Domains**: The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDepS) score was 11, and the Short Version of the GDepS (SGDepS) score was 8, which do not indicate clinically significant levels of depression. The Barthel Activities of Daily Living (Barthel-ADL) score was 20, suggesting that the subject's ability to perform daily living activities independently is preserved.\n\nConsidering these results, the subject exhibits significant impairment in visuospatial functions but relatively preserved abilities in other cognitive domains.
