The results indicate significant impairments across various cognitive domains. In attention, the subject performed poorly on the Digit Span Test (DST), both forward and backward, suggesting difficulties with working memory and attention. Language comprehension was abnormal, and repetition was at a low level, indicating potential issues with language processing. Visuospatial functions, as assessed by the Rey Complex Figure Test (RCFT), showed a below-average copy score and an exceptionally long copy time, pointing to visuospatial construction and analysis difficulties. Memory, particularly verbal memory as measured by the Seoul Verbal Learning Test - Elderly's Version (SVLT-E), was severely impaired with very low immediate and delayed recall scores, and poor recognition scores, suggesting significant difficulties in learning and retaining new information. Frontal/executive functions were also compromised, as evidenced by low scores on the Contrasting Program, Go-No go test, Digit Symbol Coding (DSC), and Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT), indicating problems with executive control, planning, and cognitive flexibility.
