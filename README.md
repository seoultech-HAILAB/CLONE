Early diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is essential to prevent its progression to Alzheimerâ€™s disease. Human expert-driven 
diagnosis provides interpretable rationales but is time-consuming, while machine learning-based approaches offer efficiency but lack 
human-readable rationales. To address these limitations, we propose **CLONE** (**Cl**inical Reas**o**ning via **N**europsychologist **E**mulation), a 
three-stage framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) for MCI diagnosis: (1) emulating experts through role-playing, (2) 
synthesizing step-by-step diagnostic guidelines, and (3) performing clinical reasoning using the guideline. CLONE was evaluated on a 
real-world dataset of 65 subjects, achieving 89.23% diagnostic accuracy and outperforming the few-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) baseline 
by 6.15%, with specificity improving by 10.71%. Moreover, the synthesized guideline enhanced rationale quality, making rationales more 
consistent, correct, specific, helpful, and human-like compared to baselines. These findings highlight CLONE's potential to enable accurate 
diagnosis and reliable clinical reasoning, addressing key challenges in the field of MCI diagnosis.

The proposed framework, CLONE, is designed to emulate expert clinical reasoning, synthesize diagnostic guidelines, and apply them for accurate and interpretable diagnoses. CLONE comprises three stages: 

1. **Emulating experts** through role-playing
2. **Synthesizing** step-by-step diagnostic **guidelines**
3. **Clinical reasoning** using the synthesized guideline.
